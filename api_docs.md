# GirlsCode MK Library API reference

## Formats

The API supports most HTTP verbs most of the time; use `GET` to fetch data, and `POST`, `PUT` or `PATCH` to write data. 

The API only returns JSON format responses.

Dates are in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, such as `YYYY-MM-DD`; for example, `2019-07-29`.

All responses are paginated, with ten responses per page. Responses include `previous` and `next` links for different pages as necessary.

Responses use HATEOAS links to hyperlink to additional information. 

### Example response

    "count": 2,

## Authentication

Authentication is by user token. Use the app admin panel to generate and examine tokens for users.

The authentication token is passed in a header with the format: 

```
Authorization:Token 856ac7748c34565498168ae500f2ccd7629a2fd2
```

Note the single space between the `Token` literal in the start of the token itself.

## Books

Book information is readable by unauthenticated users. Only users in the `Librarian` group can write to the books collection.

Book information includes links to all copies of that book.

These `GET` requests will return information about one or more books. 

* `/library/api/v1/books/`: return information on all books.
* `/library/api/v1/books`: return information on all books.
* `/library/api/v1/books/1`: return information on a specific book with ID = `1`.
* `/library/api/v1/books?search=django`: return all books with `django` in author or title fields. Search is case-insensitive and partial matches are allowed.
* `/library/api/v1/books?search=django,begin`: return all books with `django` in author or title fields _and_ `begin` in author or title fields. Search is case-insensitive and partial matches are allowed.
* `/library/api/v1/books?search=django%20begin`: return all books with `django` in author or title fields _and_ `begin` in author or title fields. Search is case-insensitive and partial matches are allowed.
* `/library/api/v1/books?title=Advanced%20Django`: return all books with the title `Advanced Django`. Searching is exact and case sensitive. 
* `/library/api/v1/books?author=Django%20author`: return all books with the author `Django author`. Searching is exact and case sensitive.

`PUT` to `/library/api/v1/books/99` to replace all the fields of an existing book with id = 99. 

`PATCH` to `/library/api/v1/books/99` to update just some fields of an existing book.

`PUT` to `/library/api/v1/copies/99` to replace all the fields of an existing copy with id = 99.

## Loans

Loan information is not visible to unauthenticated users. 

Authenticated users can view their own loans at the `myloans` endpoint. This defaults to only responding with open loans (unreturned book copies). Use the `closed=True` parameter to return instead closed loans (where the book has been returned).

These `GET` requests will return information about one or more loans. 

* `/library/api/v1/myloans/`: return information on all of the current user's open loans.
* `/library/api/v1/myloans`: return information on all of the current user's open loans.
* `/library/api/v1/myloans?closed=True`: return information on all of the current user's closed loans.
* `/library/api/v1/myloans/19409af1-48e9-464a-a629-e220059a81ac/`: return information on a specific **open** loan with ID = `19409af1-48e9-464a-a629-e220059a81ac`, so long as it is one of the current user's loans.
* `/library/api/v1/myloans/19409af1-48e9-464a-a629-e220059a81ac/?closed=True`: return information on a specific **closed** loan with ID = `19409af1-48e9-464a-a629-e220059a81ac`, so long as it is one of the current user's loans. 

Authenticated users in the `Librarian` group can view loans for any user, and can write to the Loan collection.

* `/library/api/v1/loans`: return information on all of the open loans.
